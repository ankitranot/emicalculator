# 1. Rule to remove the .html extension from the URL
# If the requested path is NOT an existing file or directory
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# And if the request is NOT for a file with an extension (e.g., .css, .js, .png)
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.html [NC,L]

# 2. (Optional but recommended) Rule to redirect anyone who types the old URL (with .html)
# This ensures search engines only index the clean URL
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\.html [NC]
RewriteRule ^ %1 [NC,L,R=301]
